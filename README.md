# Software Security project

// TODO: explain what "extra features" we have
- implicit flow detection (see tests x, y, z)
- for loops and aug assign (see tests i, j, k)
- sanitization order detection (see tests, a, b, c)

## Usage and development

- **To code**, please use a virtual environment (requires [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)):

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional (just if you're going to write code)
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

- **Before committing**, please format the code:

```bash
# From root directory
yapf -ir <files you changed>
```

- Please make sure you don't have trash files (e.g. tmp files generated by
text editor). If you do, please add them to `.gitignore`.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
./test.sh
```

To add a test `TESTNAME`, add the following files:

- `tests/<TESTNAME>.py`: the slice
- `tests/<TESTNAME>.patterns.json`: the patterns
- `tests/<TESTNAME>.output.json`: the expected output
