## Usage and development

- **To code**, please use a virtual environment (requires [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional (just if you're going to write code)
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

- **Before committing**, please format the code:

```bash
# From root directory
yapf -ir main
```

- Please make sure you don't have trash files (e.g. tmp files generated by
text editor). If you do, please add them to `.gitignore`.
